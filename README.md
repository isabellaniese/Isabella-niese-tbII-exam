Hey! If you download my code, you should note the following important facts: The mvp.py file is the main file, which includes most of the important code of "Mary Poppins". In the "scr.extras" file is mostly repetative code stored or code that would be a burden in the main file because of its length.

When you have both files ("mvp.py" and "extras.py") open, you can run the code by inserting "python3 mvp.py" in the command line of Pycharm. By "from extras import...", the program pulls important code from the "extras.py" file.
