# TechBasics II Isabella Niese: PlantyPoppins 👒👜🐝🐛🌱🪴🍄

# Hey and welcome, dear plant enthusiast!

Allow me to introduce Planty Poppins, your whimsical guide to all things green and leafy! Just like myself, this charming app is practically perfect in every way, designed to bring a spoonful of fun and a sprinkle of magic into your plant care routine.

Whether you're already a plant lover or just starting your journey into the world of greenery, With a dash of plant-loving magic, Planty Poppins is here to make plant care a delightful adventure. So, why not step into our world?

## How does Planty Poppins work?

Starting from the Homepage, the User can choose between three functions: When clicking on the first button "All my plants", the User is directed to a Page where two plants are waiting for him as a representation of plants that he/she may already have at home. The User can either water the plant (and hopefully waters his/her real plants in the main time) or check the health of its plants at home. After clicking on the second button "My next plant", the User can take a test, which will evualte preferences and come up with a plant that should fit the User! On the third button "My groceries", the User can be inspiried by an already existing shopping list with plant neccessities and put together an own shopping list, to be inspired and prepared for the next Plant-Shopping tour!
